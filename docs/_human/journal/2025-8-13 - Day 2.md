- I setup **Agent OS** to help me efficiently use **Claude**'s subagents feature. I'm wondering whether to use Claude to plan the project from inside my code editor, or if I should use it from the website's chat to keep track of separate, specialized chats ðŸ¤”
- I started working on the UI designs. To do this I used the following prompts in order:
> 	1. "based on the project context you have so far, what would be a good prompt to get an AI UI designer tool to build a first draft of the application?"
> 	2. "split the content of that prompt into one prompt per individual page that needs to be created. Make sure to repeat any information necessary to keep the visual style and experience consistent on each prompt."
- After I had the page specific prompts, I saved them to the [ui-design-prompts](../../ui-design-prompts.md).
- Then I tried the UI prompts on **Figma Make** and it produced a decent prototype of a sign-in page. It even included a functioning theme toggle.
- I'm surprised with how well this is working, but I'm unsure how to integrate figma into my workflow because, although it makes good prototypes. It won't use my tech-stack. I'll need to find a way to get something usable out of figma, to guide **Claude** through coding the UI.
