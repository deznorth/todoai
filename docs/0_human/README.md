I will use this folder to organize my notes on the experience and any other notes that will be hidden from AI agents and excluded from their context.

I won't pay much attention to what I write here so it may be a lot of "stream-of-consciousness" gibberish. You've been warned.

The docs files outside of this folder will be a mix of AI generated and human-authored information, meant to serve as context for the AI.

## Inception Idea
Build a To Do list app using AI for every piece of the project.

Use AI to:
- Draft and refine a product requirements document
- Design the UI
- Design the architecture
- Create documentation
- Build a backend and 2 front-ends (mobile and web)
