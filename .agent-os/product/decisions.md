## 2025-08-13: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TodoAI will be built as a minimalist task management MVP focused on essential features without complexity bloat, targeting students and general consumers for personal productivity.

### Context

Existing task management solutions often suffer from feature overload, poor accessibility, or complex interfaces that distract from actual productivity. The market opportunity exists for a clean, accessible, performance-focused solution.

### Rationale

- Market research shows demand for simple, accessible task management tools
- Minimalist approach reduces development complexity and maintenance overhead
- Focus on core features ensures strong foundation for future expansion
- AI-driven development experiment provides unique learning opportunities

## 2025-08-13: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
Backend: .NET 8 Web API with Domain Driven Architecture
Database: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
Authentication: JWT with HTTP-only cookies

### Context

Need to select modern, maintainable technology stack that supports rapid development while ensuring scalability, security, and performance requirements.

### Rationale

- Next.js provides excellent performance and SEO capabilities with React ecosystem
- .NET 8 offers robust, enterprise-grade backend capabilities with excellent tooling
- PostgreSQL provides reliable, scalable database solution with strong typing
- JWT with HTTP-only cookies balances security and stateless architecture
- Domain Driven Architecture ensures maintainable, testable backend code

## 2025-08-13: Authentication Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Security
**Stakeholders:** Security Lead, Tech Lead

### Decision

Implement JWT-based authentication with HTTP-only cookies for token storage, bcrypt password hashing (work factor 12), and 24-hour token expiry. No email verification for MVP.

### Context

Need secure authentication that balances security, user experience, and development complexity for MVP scope.

### Rationale

- JWT tokens provide stateless authentication suitable for distributed architecture
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks while maintaining user experience
- bcrypt with work factor 12 provides strong password protection
- 24-hour expiry balances security and user convenience
- Skipping email verification reduces MVP complexity without significant security risk

## 2025-08-13: Accessibility Requirements

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

Implement full WCAG AA accessibility compliance from day one, including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper semantic HTML structure.

### Context

Accessibility is often treated as an afterthought, leading to poor user experience for users with disabilities and potential legal compliance issues.

### Rationale

- WCAG AA compliance ensures inclusive design for all users
- Building accessibility from start is more efficient than retrofitting
- Compliance reduces legal risk and expands potential user base
- Accessibility improvements often benefit all users (better keyboard navigation, clearer visual hierarchy)

## 2025-08-13: Performance Requirements

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Target sub-2 second page load times with 99.9% uptime SLA, implementing performance monitoring and optimization from MVP launch.

### Context

User expectations for web application performance are high, and slow applications result in user abandonment and poor user experience.

### Rationale

- Sub-2 second load times align with user expectations for responsive applications
- 99.9% uptime SLA ensures reliable service for productivity-focused users
- Early performance focus prevents technical debt and scaling issues
- Performance monitoring enables proactive issue identification and resolution
