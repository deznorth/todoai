> Spec: Frontend Boilerplate Setup
> Created: 2025-08-19
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Set up a complete Next.js frontend boilerplate with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and all necessary packages configured for rapid development. This will provide a clean-slate foundation that aligns with the tech stack specifications and enables immediate feature development.

## User Stories

### Developer Setup Story

As a developer, I want to have a fully configured Next.js frontend project, so that I can immediately start building authentication pages and task management features without setup overhead.

The boilerplate should include all dependencies installed, TypeScript configured, Tailwind CSS set up with dark/light theme support, shadcn/ui components library initialized, and basic project structure established for scalable development.

## Spec Scope

1. **Next.js Project Initialization** - Create new Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript and App Router
2. **Styling Framework Setup** - Configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme and dark/light mode support
3. **UI Component Library** - Install and configure shadcn/ui for accelerated component development
4. **Development Dependencies** - Install ESLint, Prettier, and testing frameworks per tech stack
5. **Project Structure** - Establish organized folder structure following Next.js best practices

## Out of Scope

- Authentication implementation (login/signup pages)
- Task management components and pages
- Backend API integration
- Deployment configuration
- Database connectivity

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete Next.js project with all dependencies installed and configured
2. Working development server that starts without errors
3. Basic theme toggle functionality demonstrating dark/light mode switching
